# PyBer_Analysis
## Analysis Overview
V.Isualize has given me an assignment to create an analysis demonstrating the ridesharing data at PyBer. Specifically, V.Isualize wants to know the total number of rides, drivers, and fares by city type. Additionally, this analysis needs to provide data on the average fare per ride & driver by city type, and finally plot the total fare amounts by month in 2019 for each city type. 
## Results

Clearly, urban cities had the most total rides, drivers, and fares. However, they had the cheapest average fare per ride and the lowest fare per driver. Meanwhile, rural cities had the fewest rides, drivers, and total fares, but had the highest average fare per ride and driver. 

Urban Cities collected nearly $40,000 in total fares among 1625 total rides and 2405 total drivers. This resulted in $24.53 per ride and $16.57 per driver on average
Suburan cities had 625 total rides from 490 drivers that resulted in over $19,000 in fares. They had $30.97 per ride and $39.50 collected per driver.
Rural cities had a mere 125 total rides from 78 drivers that resulted in a meager $4,327 in fares. However, this meant that rides were $34.62 on average and $55.49 per driver.

Throughout the selected dataset of ride sharing data of January 1st, 2019 - April 28th, 2019, urban cities had the highest total fares, suburban cities had the second largest total, and rural cities were in 3rd. The most fares collected were in the final weeks of February and first weeks of March, where urban cities collected about $2500 in total fares. 

Urban cities poorest performance came the first week of the year but was steadily treading upwards throughout the chart. Suburban cities weree relatively consistent with weekly earning between about $750 - $1250. 

Rural cities were consistently last, with no weekly earnings exceeding $500. In fact, there were several weeks in January and February where barely any fare was collected at all. 

## Summary
1) There are more drivers in urban cities than there are rides, and this is causing there to be a significantly higher average fare per ride than average fare per driver. Meanwhile, suburban and rural cities have much fewer drivers than total rides so it may be prudent to send some urban drivers to help out those two city types.
2) Urban cities have by far the largest amount of rides, yet are averaging the least amount of fare per ride. This is the perfect situation to increase prices in urban cities. 
3) Rural cities have the fewest total rides and the highest average fare. I would recommend lowering costs in rural cities to encourage more people to use PyBer as a ride sharing service.
